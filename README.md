# Decentralized websites on Peerster network
Adaptation of the Peerster client which allows upload and seamless browsing of static websites in a decentralized manner.
Website files are content-addressed and stored in a Kademlia DHT. IPNS style pointer records are introduced to allow editing files while keeping them under the same address in the DHT. 

Project for CS-438 (Decentralized Systems Engineering) at EPFL.
