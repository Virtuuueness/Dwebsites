# Decentralized websites on Peerster network
Adaptation of the Peerster client which allows upload and seamless browsing of static websites in a decentralized manner.
Website files are split into chunks which are content-addressed and stored throughout the network. The DHT holds global info on who holds what chunk. IPNS style pointer records are introduced to allow editing files while keeping them under the same address in the DHT.
